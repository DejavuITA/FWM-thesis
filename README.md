The comsol directory should be empty because it contains big comsol file stored in locale.
(pick the FWM_template.empty.mph and run with comsol, then save it in the comsol/ folder)

To run matlab files you should be in the files' folder. For example to run the extractor
one should be in the comsol-extractor/ folder, to run the phase matching file should be
in the phase-matching/ folder

In data/ are stored data files estracted from .mph files
